This repository is a website project from ITMD 362 course.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: You will create a compelling, multi-page process that walks
a user through
payment, billing, and shipping options to complete the order of a pre-selected
set of items in the userâ€™s shopping cart. The goal of this project is to
experiment with patterns of interaction that make it as effortless as possible
for users to complete a purchase, which is not an easy task.

Design for straightforward, engaging entry of personal information. Include
friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or
incomplete information. And bring a full suite of validators, linters, and
visual regression tests to ensure code quality from your earliest commits.
